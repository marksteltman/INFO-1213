        <p>As a cool guy it is my job to not only be cool but to make it look effortless. To apear as if everything i do comes naturally and did not take years of training. I spent the School for Coolness has given me just that. 4 years of training to eat, breath and sleep coolness. 
           After my 4 year stint of school i worked under Sir Vincent McCooler the 3rd as his assistant for 4 more years. McCooler released me on the fourth year, convinced that i was ready to go out on my own. Ill admit it was challenging to go out on my own but I was indeed ready.
           I have been a private contracter as a professional cool guy for several years now and .
